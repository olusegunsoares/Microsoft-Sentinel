# Microsoft Sentinel Security Operations

This project demonstrates how I implemented end-to-end security operations using Microsoft Sentinel to protect cloud resources and respond to threats in real time. It covers deploying Azure infrastructure, integrating data connectors, writing KQL queries for detection, managing incidents, and enriching analysis with threat intelligence. The result is a hands-on showcase of my ability to design, configure, and operate a modern SIEM for proactive cloud security monitoring and defense.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project demonstrates how to build and manage a **cloud-based SIEM** solution using Microsoft Sentinel. It covers deployment, log collection, incident detection, automation, threat intelligence integration, and proactive threat hunting.

## 🛠️ Objectives Completed
- **Deploy Azure Resources**: Setup of Virtual Machine (VM) and Sentinel workspace.  
- **Log Ingestion**: Connected Windows Security Events to Sentinel via data connectors.  
- **Threat Detection**:  
  - Detected failed authentication attempts.  
  - Detected file access and modification events.  
- **Integration**: Connected Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Sentinel.  
- **Incident Management**: Managed and classified incidents using automation rules.  
- **Threat Hunting**: Used KQL queries to hunt for suspicious activity.  
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrated TI feeds and launched hunts using TI objects.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Capstone_Report.docx` → Full written report of the project.  
- `queries/` → KQL queries for log analysis and hunting.  
- `docs/` → Step-by-step setup and configuration notes.  
- `screenshots/` → Visual evidence of detections, alerts, and hunts.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Centralized SIEM integration improves visibility and response.  
- KQL queries are powerful for fine-tuned detection.  
- Threat Intelligence enriches analysis and improves decision-making.  
- Automation enhances efficiency and reduces response time.  
- Proactive hunting strengthens cloud security posture.
