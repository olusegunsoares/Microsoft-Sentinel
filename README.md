# Microsoft Sentinel Security Operations – Capstone Project

This repository documents the implementation of advanced **security operations and monitoring in Microsoft Sentinel**, completed as part of my Post Graduate Program in Cybersecurity at UT Austin, McCombs School of Business.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project demonstrates how to build and manage a **cloud-based SIEM** solution using Microsoft Sentinel. It covers deployment, log collection, incident detection, automation, threat intelligence integration, and proactive threat hunting.

## 🛠️ Objectives Completed
- **Deploy Azure Resources**: Setup of Virtual Machine (VM) and Sentinel workspace.  
- **Log Ingestion**: Connected Windows Security Events to Sentinel via data connectors.  
- **Threat Detection**:  
  - Detected failed authentication attempts.  
  - Detected file access and modification events.  
- **Integration**: Connected Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Sentinel.  
- **Incident Management**: Managed and classified incidents using automation rules.  
- **Threat Hunting**: Used KQL queries to hunt for suspicious activity.  
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrated TI feeds and launched hunts using TI objects.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Capstone_Report.docx` → Full written report of the project.  
- `queries/` → KQL queries for log analysis and hunting.  
- `docs/` → Step-by-step setup and configuration notes.  
- `screenshots/` → Visual evidence of detections, alerts, and hunts.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Centralized SIEM integration improves visibility and response.  
- KQL queries are powerful for fine-tuned detection.  
- Threat Intelligence enriches analysis and improves decision-making.  
- Automation enhances efficiency and reduces response time.  
- Proactive hunting strengthens cloud security posture.  

## 📖 About This Project
