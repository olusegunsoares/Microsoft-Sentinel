Initiate a Threat Intelligence (TI) Hunt in Microsoft Sentinel by navigating to Hunting, selecting + New Hunt, and configuring details such as Hunt Name, Description, Owner, and Hypothesis. Once created, add relevant TI queries by filtering for Threat Intelligence and selecting all available queries. Execute the hunt by running all queries and reviewing results within five minutes. If logs match TI objects, create an incident by selecting Create Incident from the Actions dropdown, confirm pre-filled details, assign ownership, and finalize the creation. Verify the incident under the Incidents blade by filtering for those assigned to you.
