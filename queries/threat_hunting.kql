Evaluate your cloud instance for potential malicious Initial Access attempts by navigating to Microsoft Sentinel > Incidents. In the Hunting section, under Queries, install new queries from the Content Hub by searching for Azure Activity and completing the installation. Once installed, filter queries by the Initial Access tactic (Add Filter > Tactics > Initial Access), then analyze the results. If no results appear, it indicates no logged attempts of unauthorized access via phishing, drive-by compromise, or exploitation of public-facing applications.
