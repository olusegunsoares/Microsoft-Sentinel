The process begins with the deployment of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, followed by Microsoft Sentinel to enable advanced security monitoring. If Sentinel is already deployed, proceed to install the Microsoft Training Lab solution from the Marketplace. To establish a connection between Defender for Cloud and Sentinel, install the relevant Data Connector via the Content Hub, search for Microsoft Defender for Cloud, select it, and proceed with the installation. Once installed, navigate to Manage > Configuration Page, choose Subscription-based Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Legacy), and toggle the connection status to Connected. Verify the successful connection by checking the Data Connector page in Sentinel, where the status should be highlighted in Green.
With the connection established, create an Analytics Rule to ensure security alerts from Defender for Cloud are logged as Incidents in Sentinel. Navigate to Analytics > Create > Microsoft Incident Creation Rule, provide a Name and Description, enable the rule, and set the Microsoft Security Service to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, filtering severity as Any before saving the configuration. To validate the setup, generate sample alerts in Defender for Cloud by selecting Sample Alerts, ensuring the correct subscription and plans are selected, then create the alerts. Finally, navigate to the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents Page, where the generated sample alerts should now be reflected as Incidents on the dashboard, confirming successful integration.
