Configure Microsoft Sentinel with Threat Intelligence (TI) data by navigating to the Threat Intelligence blade. If no TI objects are present, select Visit TI solution in Content Hub and install the Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence solution. Once installed, open the Connector page, select Connect, and refresh the Threat Intelligence page to verify the newly added objects. These TI objects enhance incident analysis by enriching alerts with contextual data, supporting KQL-based threat hunting, and integrating into automation and detection rules.
